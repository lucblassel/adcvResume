  abstract = {Phylogenetic inference aims at reconstructing the tree describing
              the evolution of a set of sequences descending from a common
              ancestor. The high computational cost of state-of-the-art Maximum
              likelihood and Bayesian inference methods limits their usability
              under realistic evolutionary models. Harnessing recent advances in
              likelihood-free inference and geometric deep learning, we introduce
              Phyloformer, a fast and accurate method for evolutionary distance
              estimation and phylogenetic reconstruction. Sampling many trees and
              sequences under an evolutionary model, we train the network to
              learn a function that enables predicting the former from the
              latter. Under a commonly used model of protein sequence evolution
              and exploiting GPU acceleration, it outpaces fast distance methods
              while matching maximum likelihood accuracy on simulated and
              empirical data. Under more complex models, some of which include
              dependencies between sites, it outperforms other methods. Our
              results pave the way for the adoption of sophisticated realistic
              models for phylogenetic inference.Competing Interest StatementThe

  abstract = {Summary Sequencing errors continue to pose algorithmic challenges
              to methods working with sequencing data. One of the simplest and
              most prevalent techniques for ameliorating the detrimental effects
              of homopolymer expansion/contraction errors present in long reads
              is homopolymer compression. It collapses runs of repeated
              nucleotides, to remove some sequencing errors and improve mapping
              sensitivity. Though our intuitive understanding justifies why
              homopolymer compression works, it in no way implies that it is the
              best transformation that can be done. In this paper, we explore if
              there are transformations that can be applied in the same
              pre-processing manner as homopolymer compression that would achieve
              better alignment sensitivity. We introduce a more general framework
              than homopolymer compression, called mapping-friendly sequence
              reductions. We transform the reference and the reads using these
              reductions and then apply an alignment algorithm. We demonstrate
              that some mapping-friendly sequence reductions lead to improved
              mapping accuracy, outperforming homopolymer compression.},
