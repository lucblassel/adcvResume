  abstract = {Phylogenetic inference aims at reconstructing the tree describing
              the evolution of a set of sequences descending from a common
              ancestor. The high computational cost of state-of-the-art maximum
              likelihood and Bayesian inference methods limits their usability
              under realistic evolutionary models. Harnessing recent advances in
              likelihood-free inference and geometric deep learning, we introduce
              Phyloformer, a fast and accurate method for evolutionary distance
              estimation and phylogenetic reconstruction. Sampling many trees and
              sequences under an evolutionary model, we train the network to
              learn a function that enables predicting a tree from a multiple
              sequence alignment. On simulated data, we compare Phyloformer to
              FastME –a distance method– and two maximum likelihood methods:
              FastTree and IQTree. Under a commonly used model of protein
              sequence evolution and exploiting GPU acceleration, Phyloformer
              outpaces all other approaches and exceeds their accuracy in the
              Kuhner-Felsenstein metric that accounts for both the topology and
              branch lengths. In terms of topological accuracy alone, Phyloformer
              outperforms FastME, but falls behind maximum likelihood approaches,
              especially as the number of sequences increases. When a model of
              sequence evolution that includes dependencies between sites is used
              , Phyloformer outperforms all other methods across all metrics on
              alignments with fewer than 80 sequences. On 3801 empirical gene
              alignments from 5 different datasets, Phyloformer matches the
              topological accuracy of the two maximum likelihood implementations.
              Our results pave the way for the adoption of sophisticated
              realistic models for phylogenetic inference.},

  abstract = {Summary Sequencing errors continue to pose algorithmic challenges
              to methods working with sequencing data. One of the simplest and
              most prevalent techniques for ameliorating the detrimental effects
              of homopolymer expansion/contraction errors present in long reads
              is homopolymer compression. It collapses runs of repeated
              nucleotides, to remove some sequencing errors and improve mapping
              sensitivity. Though our intuitive understanding justifies why
              homopolymer compression works, it in no way implies that it is the
              best transformation that can be done. In this paper, we explore if
              there are transformations that can be applied in the same
              pre-processing manner as homopolymer compression that would achieve
              better alignment sensitivity. We introduce a more general framework
              than homopolymer compression, called mapping-friendly sequence
              reductions. We transform the reference and the reads using these
              reductions and then apply an alignment algorithm. We demonstrate
              that some mapping-friendly sequence reductions lead to improved
              mapping accuracy, outperforming homopolymer compression.},
