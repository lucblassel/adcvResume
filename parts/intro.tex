  I am a PhD student in computational biology at the Institut Pasteur in France. I started with biology studies in AgroParisTech, a Parisian ``Grande Ã©cole'' but quickly found my way to machine learning. In order to complete my M.Sc, I entered the Institut Pasteur as an intern, and found the fascinating world of academic research.

  I have since continued on, entering a PhD program in computational biology, exploring the interface between biology, computer science and machine learning.

  This interdisciplinary experience drives me to further explore computational methods to resolve problems of a biological nature.
