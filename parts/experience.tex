      Using machine learning with sequence data. With the ever growing quantity of high quality sequencing data, we are now able to develop methods to take advantage of this data. My PhD project follows 2 different axes: (1) Using machine learning to discover Drug resistance mutations in HIV (Continuation of the M.Sc project) (2) Search of a function space for sequence transformation functions that improve sequence mapping and alignment.

Supervized by \href{https://prairie-institute.fr/chairs/gascuel-olivier/}{Olivier Gascuel}. A large dataset of UK HIV sequences associated with patient RT-treatment status was used to train several machine learning algorithms. Examining the importatnt learned features gave us insight in mutations associated to ART failure. This project resulted in a \hyperref[sec:publications]{publication}. }

  \ifextended
    \adcvrowmulti{As a data scientist intern at Capital data I was tasked with developing a software pipeline to validate data prior to database integration, and detect anomalies usign time series. This was implemented in R and Python. I also, developed reporting-oriented data visualizations of KPIs using BIME and Tableau. Finally statistical AB-testing was also done using python.}
